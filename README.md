# SI-206-Final-Project
First off, the user will want to run api-caller-stock-weather.py. This code will call both the MetaWeather API's and the Polygon stock API's and will put this code into a database and make calculations based on that code which will go into averageStocks.csv and averageTemp.csv. The database will be stored in final_project.db. Next, the user will want to run stock_weather_scraper.py to do the BeautifulSoup analysis on three different articles and make all the vizulizations that can be seen in the slides (206-final-project-slides.pdf)
